.SH \m[cyan]DESCRIPTION\m[]
The

program is a minimal command-line interpreter written in C for educational purposes.
It reads commands from standard input, tokenizes them by whitespace, resolves the
executable via the
.B PATH
environment variable or by absolute/relative paths, and executes commands in child processes.
It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes and implements a small set of built-ins.

In interactive mode, the prompt displayed is
.B "($) "
. In non-interactive mode, commands can be piped in or read from redirected input.
