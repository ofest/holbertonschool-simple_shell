# 🐚 Holberton Simple shell
## 📌 Description
This project is a custom shell named hsh for Holberton shell.
It was developed as out fourth group project at Holberton School with the goal to reinforce everything we saw for the C language, all within a peer programming environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 🛠️ Technologies Used
[![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?logo=c&logoColor=white)](#)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-%23121011.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white)](#)
[![GCC](https://img.shields.io/badge/gcc-13.3.0-blue)](#)

## 🧭 Overview
`hsh` reads lines from standard input, tokenizes the input, resolves commands using the `PATH` environment variable, and executes them in child processes. It supports interactive and non-interactive modes and implements a small set of built-ins.

## ✨ Features
- Execute programs by absolute/relative path or via `PATH`
- Argument parsing separated by whitespace
- Built-ins: `exit`, `env`
- Interactive prompt: `($) `
- Non-interactive (piped or redirected) execution
- Basic error reporting for unknown commands and system call failures

### ✅ Requirements
- GCC (version 13.3.0 or higher recommended)
- Make (optional, for easier compilation)
- Unix-like OS (tested on [![Arch Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch-1793D1?logo=arch-linux&logoColor=fff)](#), [![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](#)).

## 🛠️ Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ofest/holbertonschool-simple_shell
cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
make
```
This produces an executable named `hsh` in the project root.

## ▶️ Usage
### 💬 Interactive mode
```sh
./hsh
($) ls -l
($) exit
```
Exit with Ctrl-D (EOF) or the `exit` built-in.

### 🤖 Non-interactive mode
```sh
echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
# or
./hsh < scriptfile
```

### 🔗 Optional alias
Create a convenient alias (adjust the absolute path to your clone):
```sh
alias hsh='/absolute/path/to/holbertonschool-simple_shell/hsh'
```
Persist the alias by adding the same line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

## 🧰 Built-ins
- `exit`: terminate the shell process
- `env`: print the current environment, one variable per line

## 🚪 Exit status
- The shell process exits with code 0 on normal termination.
- Internal failures may cause an exit code of 1.

## 🔍 Examples
```sh
# Run a command from PATH
($) echo Hello
Hello

# Run with an absolute path
($) /bin/ls

# Command not found (example)
($) foo
./hsh: 1: foo: not found
```

## 📖 Man page (with colors)
To view the manual with colors support enabled:
```sh
groff -k -Tutf8 -man man_1_simple_shell | less -R
```
You can also use:
```sh
man -l man_1_simple_shell
```
(Depending on your `man`/`less` configuration, color output may vary.)

## 📂 File Descriptions

- main.c → Entry point; runs the main shell loop (read, parse, execute).

- shell.c → Core logic for executing commands, forking, and handling PATH resolution.

- builtins.c → Implements built-in commands (exit, env).

- helpers.c → Utility functions (string parsing, memory helpers, PATH resolution).

- shell.h → Header file with function prototypes, includes, and global variables.

- man_1_simple_shell → Manual page for the shell.

- Makefile → Automates compilation of the project.

- AUTHORS → Project contributors.

- LICENSE → License information (GPLv3).

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No support for advanced shell features (;, &&, ||, pipes |, redirections < > >>, etc.).

- Limited error handling (basic messages, no detailed diagnostics).

- Only two built-ins implemented: exit and env.
